Hi there.

I'm going to look at an object.
(Wavelength = 662.)
I see red.
It reminds me of firetrucks.

Cool. Now, let me see if it feels like something to see red.
Does it feel like something to see red?
Answer: yes
Ok, but _why_ does it feel like something to see red?
This seems completely unexplained. It's clear that my brain can perceive colors, but why, when I ask myself whether there's something it feels like to perceive these inputs, do I realize that yes, there is something it's like? Hmm. Off to read more David Chalmers, I guess.
